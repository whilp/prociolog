   contain the root `toctree` directive.

prociolog --- log data sent to and from a subprocess
====================================================

:mod:`prociolog` helps you keep track of how your programs interact with
subprocesses. Every time data is sent to or from a subprocess, this module will
also send the data to a logger so that you can audit and inspect the
communication programmatically or by digging through log files later on.
:mod:`prociolog` is convenient glue for two of the standard library's most
useful modules: :mod:`logging` and :mod:`subprocess` (though anything that
implements the basic parts of either API can be easily shoehorned in, too).

A note about versions
+++++++++++++++++++++

This module is developed along two branches. The first, 'default' (or 'master'
in git) contains new features and possible bugs -- this branch is the active
development branch. The second, 'stable', contains releases both major and minor
as well as bugfixes. If you'd like to help, take a look at default/master.
Otherwise, stick with stable.
